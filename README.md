# Minimal_models
Automatic scripts for scanning over the parameter space of Minimal Models connecting neutrino and dark sectors.
The code checks against constraints from Dark Matter relic density, Spin-Independent cross sections at the XENON experiment, collider constraints (LHC, LEP), Lepton Flavour Violating (LFV) processes and neutrino parameter measurements.
